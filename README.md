This org is creating web applications that can be run on any old server, in the main the objective is to create deployable Single Page Applications for businesses which they can deploy on pretty much anything that can serve up a web page.

The first project is to cut down a PWA into a SPA that can be deployed to a OpenWRT device (as Rasps are out of stock everywhere).

This Git is for the 'local.example.com' domain which will bring the users attention to the fact that if they arrive at the site their server is not working as expected.
